### How do I plan a burial for a family member who's just died?

#### If you have a pre-need decision letter confirming they can be buried in a VA national cemetery:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director can call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at <a href="tel:+18005351117">800-535-1117</a> to request a burial.

You don’t need to do anything else except prepare yourself and your family for the funeral. [Find out what to expect at a funeral](/burials-and-memorials/what-to-expect-at-a-funeral/).

#### If you don't have a pre-need decision letter:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director will need to take these 2 steps to apply for a burial.

<li class="process-step list-one">

##### Gather the information and documents you'll need to identify the deceased

You'll need:

 - The DD214 or other discharge papers of the deceased or the Servicemember or Veteran whose military service will be used to decide if the deceased qualifies for burial in a VA national cemetery. If you can't find these discharge papers, please ask for our help to get these records. [Find out which discharge papers we accept along with your application](http://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/hmm/discharge_documents.asp). 
 
You'll also need the deceased's:

 - Full name
 - Gender
 - Social Security number or Military Service number (Veteran ID)
 - Date of birth
 - Relationship to the Servicemember or Veteran whose military service will be used to decide eligibility
 - Marital status
 - Date of death and zip code and county at the time of death
 - Next-of-kin information, including:
  - Name
  - Relationship to the deceased
  - Social Security number
  - Phone number
  - Address
 
You may also need more information in certain cases:

- **If the deceased was married**, you'll also need the surviving spouse’s status as Servicemember/Veteran or family member
- **If the deceased has any children with disabilities**, you'll need the status and detailed information for any disabled children who may be buried in the future in a national cemetery
- **If the deceased is a spouse of a Servicemember or Veteran whose spouse has already died**, you'll need the full name of the spouse who died in the past as well as the cemetery section and site number where they're buried
