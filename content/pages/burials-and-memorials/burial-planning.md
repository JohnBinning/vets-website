### How do I plan a burial for a deceased family member?

#### If you have a pre-need decision letter confirming they can be buried in a VA national cemetery:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director can call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at <a href="tel:+18005351117">800-535-1117</a> to request a burial.

You don’t need to do anything else except prepare yourself and your family for the funeral. [Find out what to expect at a funeral](/burials-and-memorials/what-to-expect-at-a-funeral/). 

#### If you don't have a pre-need decision letter:

To start, you may want to choose a funeral director to help you plan the burial. Then either you or the funeral director will need to take these 2 steps to apply for a burial.

##### Gather these documents and other information you'll need to identify the deceased:

 - DD214, or similar discharge papers. If you can't find the discharge papers, please ask for our help to get these records. [Find out which discharge papers we accept along with your application](http://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/hmm/discharge_documents.asp).

 - Next-of-kin information (name, relationship, Social Security number, phone number, and address)
 - Marital status
 - The Veteran’s zip code and county at the time of death

You may also need more information in certain cases:

- **If the deceased was married**, you'll also need the surviving spouse’s status as Veteran or family member
- **If the deceased has any children with disabilities**, you'll need the status and detailed information for any disabled children who may be buried in the future in a national cemetery
- **If the deceased is a spouse or a Veteran whose spouse has already died**, you'll need the full name of the family member, cemetery section, and site number
