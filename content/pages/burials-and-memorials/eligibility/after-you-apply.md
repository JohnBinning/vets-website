Find out what happens after you apply for a Pre-Need Eligibility Determination for burial in a VA national cemetery.

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information" markdown="0">
<span class="number">About 90 days</span>
<span class="description">The amount of time it takes to review your application depends on:
- The number of applications we're reviewing, **and**
- How much information you've provided <br />
If more than 90 days has passed since you gave us your application and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call <a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>.</span>
</div>

### What should I do while I wait?

You don't need to do anything while you wait. We'll contact you if we need more information to review your application. 

### What happens after I receive a decision?

You’ll get a letter from us telling you if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. This is called your pre-need decision letter. Keep it in a safe place. Your family members will need this letter to request your burial after you’ve died.
