Find out what happens after you apply for a pre-Need eligibility Determination for burial in a VA national cemetery.

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information" markdown="0">
<span class="number">About 90 days</span>
<span class="description">If more than 90 days has passed since you gave us your application and you haven’t heard back, please don’t apply again. Call <a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>.</span>
</div>

The amount of time it takes to review your application depends on:
- The number of applications we're reviewing, **and**
- How much information you've provided in your application, **and**
- Whether you provided your (or your sponsor's) DD214 or other separation documents along with your application

<br>

### What should I do while I wait?

You don't need to do anything while you wait. We'll contact you if we need more information to review your application. 

<br>

### How will I receive VA's decision of eligibility?

You’ll receive a VA burial and memorial benefits folder from us in the mail. This folder will include:

- A letter telling you if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. This is called your pre-need decision letter. 
- A National Cemetery Administration brochure and burial benefits information sheet. These will tell you more about the benefits you'll receive upon burial in a VA national cemetery.
- A copy of the supporting documents you submitted with your application

<br>

#### What should I do after I receive my pre-need letter and folder?

Keep your VA burial and memorial Benefits folder in a safe place. Talk to your family members or authorized representative about your burial wishes—including any memorialization requests and inscriptions—and make sure they know where your benefits folder is located. They'll need this information to request your burial after your death.

We'll also keep a copy of your letter and supporting documents in our system to help speed up burial arrangements at your time of need. When a burial is requested, we'll confirm your pre-need eligibility determination based on the laws in effect at that time.

<br>

#### If VA decides I qualify for burial in a VA national cemetery, what happens when I die?

When you die, the person arranging your burial will need to call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at 800-535-1117 to request a burial. They'll need your pre-need eligibility determination letter at that time. [Find out more about planning a burial for a family member who's died](/burials-and-memorials/burial-planning).

<br>

#### If VA denies my pre-need application, can my family member or personal representative still apply for my burial in a VA national cemetery after I die?

Yes. They can apply for your burial in a VA national cemetery after you die even if we've already denied your pre-need burial eligibility. Laws and personal circumstances may change earlier eligibility decisions. We'll make the final decision of whether you qualify for burial at the time of need.
