### Can I get VA dental care benefits for some or all of my dental care?

It depends on a number of factors, like your military service history and your current health and living situation. Based on these factors, VA places you into a benefits class—and you get the specific benefits assigned to that class.

Use the table below to find out which benefits you may qualify for.

You may be able to buy dental insurance at a reduced cost through the VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP) if you:
