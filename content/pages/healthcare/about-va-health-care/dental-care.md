<div class="va-introtext">

If you qualify for VA dental care benefits, you may be able to get some or all of your dental care through VA. Find out how to get VA dental care or how to buy dental insurance if you don’t qualify.

### Can I get VA dental care benefits for some or all of my dental care?

It depends on a number of factors, like your military service history and your current health and living situation. Based on these factors, VA places you into a benefits class—and you get the specific benefits assigned to that class. See the section below for more information.
