Talk to your primary health care provider or your local VA environmental health coordinator about any health concerns related to your military service. [Find your local VA environmental health coordinator](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp). 

- **If you have embedded fragments,** ask about getting an exam through the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center. [Download our Toxic Embedded Fragments fact sheet](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/exposures/TEFSC-veterans-fact-sheet.pdf).  
- **If you think you had contact with depleted uranium,** ask about getting screened through the Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program. [Learn more about the program](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/followup_program.asp).

</li>
