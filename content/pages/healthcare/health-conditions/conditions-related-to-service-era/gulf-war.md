### What should I do now?

Take these steps to make sure you’re taking care of your health:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

Talk to your primary health care provider or your local VA environmental health coordinator about any health concerns related to your military service. [Find your local VA environmental health coordinator](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp). 

- **If you have embedded fragments,** ask about getting an exam through the Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center. [Download our Toxic Embedded Fragments fact sheet](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/exposures/TEFSC-veterans-fact-sheet.pdf).  

- **If you think you had contact with depleted uranium,** ask about getting screened through the Depleted Uranium Follow-up Program. [Learn more about the program](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/depleted_uranium/followup_program.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

Ask about getting a free exam and joining these registries to document your exposures and health concerns:

[The Gulf War Registry](http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/benefits/registry-exam.asp)
<br />
[The Ionizing Radiation Registry](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/radiation/benefits/registry-exam.asp)

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

Find out if you can get disability compensation (monthly payments) and other benefits if you have a health condition caused or made worse by your active-duty service.
