### What services does VA provide for PTSD?

We have almost 200 PTSD treatment programs across the country that offer:

- 1-to-1 mental health assessment and testing to figure out if you have PTSD
- Medicine proven to work for treating PTSD
- 1-to-1 psychotherapy (also called talk therapy). [This includes proven methods like Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)](http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/ptsd/cbt-ptsd.asp). 
- 1-to-1 family therapy
- Group therapy for special needs, like anger or stress management or combat support
- Group therapy for Veterans who served in certain combat zones or who’ve been through similar traumas

We also offer other forms of treatment and support:

- PTSD specialists provide regular outpatient care to Veterans with PTSD in each VA medical center across the U.S. 
- Special residential (live-in) or inpatient care programs—found in each region of the U.S.—help Veterans with severe PTSD symptoms who have trouble doing normal daily activities (like going to work).
- Providers offer added PTSD care in some of our large community-based outpatient clinics. <br />

[Find a VA medical center or clinic](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division.asp?dnum=1). 

<br>

**Please note:** If you don’t live near a VA medical center or clinic, our mental health providers can counsel you over the phone (called telemental health care). Or, we can refer you to a Vet Center or health care provider near you.

### How do I access VA services for PTSD? 

PTSD health services are covered under the VA health care program. To access these services, first apply for VA health care. [Apply for health care](/healthcare/apply).

Once you’re signed up: 

- **If you have a VA primary care provider,** talk to them about your concerns. Your provider can help you figure out if you have PTSD—and can offer treatment and support as needed.
- **If you don’t have a VA primary care provider or have never been seen in a VA hospital or clinic:**
  - Call our general information hotline at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">800-827-1000</a>, **or**
  - [Contact your local VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/health/vamc/), **or** 
  - [Contact a VA PTSD program near you](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/PTSD.asp).

### What if I don’t have VA health benefits?

You may still be able to get care: 
- **If you’ve served in a combat zone,** get free, private counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers. [Find a Vet Center near you](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/vetcenter.asp). 
- **If you’re homeless or at risk of becoming homeless:** 
  - Visit our website to learn about VA programs for Veterans who are homeless. [Visit www.va.gov/homeless](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).
  - Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+1phonenumber">877-424-3838</a>) anytime day or night. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homeless programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential (private).
  - Call or visit your local VA Community  Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community. [Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center]( https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp).

### Can I get disability compensation (monthly payments) or other benefits from VA if I think I have PTSD linked to military service?

If you have symptoms of PTSD and suffered a serious injury, personal trauma, sexual trauma, or were threatened with injury, sexual assault, or death while serving in the military, you may be able to get disability compensation or benefits.
