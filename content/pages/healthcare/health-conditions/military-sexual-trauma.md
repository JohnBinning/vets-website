<div class="va-introtext">

Military sexual trauma (MST) refers to sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment that happened while a Veteran was in the military. This can happen to both women and men. If you were involved in any sexual act against your will during your time in the military, you may have experienced MST. Find out how to access our free services that can help you recover.

### How do I access VA services for MST? 

If you’re a Veteran who has experienced MST, you can get help through VA. You don’t need to have a service-connected disability rating, and you may be able to get MST-related care even if you don’t qualify for other VA services. You also don’t need to have reported the MST or have other proof that it happened.

Here’s how to access VA services for MST:

- **If you have a VA primary care provider,** talk to that professional about what you’ve been through. All our primary care providers are trained in MST and can help you figure out if you have related issues, like PTSD or depression. Your provider will offer treatment and support as needed.
- **If you don’t have a VA primary care provider,** call your local VA medical center and ask to speak to the MST coordinator. You should feel free to ask for a provider of a specific gender if that makes you feel more comfortable. [Connect with your medical center](https://www.va.gov/health/vamc/). 
- **If you’ve served in a combat zone,** get free, private counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers. [Find a Vet Center near you](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/vetcenter.asp). 
- **If you’re a homeless Veteran, get mental health care:**
  - At a Veterans drop-in center, **or**
  - By contacting the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 877-424-3838, or 
  - By visiting our Homeless Veterans website. [Visit the VA Homeless Veterans website](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).

You can also call the VA general information hotline at 800-827-1000.

### Can I get disability compensation (monthly payments) or other benefits from VA?

You can’t get compensation for the traumatic event itself. But you may be able to get disability compensation for conditions resulting from MST—like PTSD (the most common mental health condition linked to MST). [Find out if you can get disability benefits for PTSD](/disability-benefits/conditions/ptsd/). 

Or, get help applying for disability compensation by:

- Reading our fact sheet on disability compensation for conditions related to MST. [Download the fact sheet](http://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/serviceconnected/MST.pdf).
- Talking to the MST coordinator at your local VA regional benefits office. [Find an MST coordinator near you](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/mstcoordinators.asp).
