### What women's health services does VA provide?

We provide primary care services, including:

- General services, like disease prevention and nutrition counseling
- Female-specific services, like birth control, preconception counseling, and menopausal support (hormone replacement therapy)
- Screenings, like cervical cancer screens (Pap smears) and breast cancer screens (mammograms)
- Mental health services for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use problems. [Learn more about mental health services](/healthcare/health-conditions/mental-health/).
- Free, confidential (private) counseling and treatment for mental and physical health conditions related to military sexual trauma (MST). [Learn more about services for MST](/healthcare/health-conditions/military-sexual-trauma/).
 
We also provide specialty services, including:

- Screening and management of chronic (long-lasting) conditions, like heart disease and diabetes
- Screening and management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis
- Maternity care and other reproductive health services
- Treatment for sexual problems, urinary incontinence, and other issues
- Prosthetic and sensory aid (PSA) services, like prosthetic limbs, hearing aids, and post-mastectomy items. [Download our fact sheet on prosthetic and sensory services for women Veterans](https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/factsheet/PSAS-FactSheet-WomenVets.pdf). 
- Referrals for physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, and other rehabilitation therapies
- [Homebound and long-term care for those who meet specific requirements](/healthcare/about-va-health-care/assisted-living-and-home-health-care)

Please note that we cannot, by law, provide abortion services. 

Through legislation announced January 19, 2017, we are expanding our fertility services to include counseling and treatment using assisted reproductive technologies—including in vitro fertilization (IVF). These services will be available to Veterans and spouses of Veterans who have a service-connected disability that makes it impossible for them to have a baby without the help of fertility treatment. Veterans can begin scheduling appointments to find out if they qualify and to get a clinical exam, consultation, and initial treatment as we work to build the program’s structure. [Learn more about the recent changes in IVF coverage](https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2854).

### How can I get help related to sexual trauma?
