We provide mental health services such as:

- Regular outpatient care, which may include care provided over the phone, for Veterans facing a difficult time in their lives
- Rehabilitation treatment and residential (live-in) programs for Veterans with mental health problems and other needs (like those related to homelessness, job training, and education) who would be best helped by getting treatment or living in a structured setting for a period of time
- Primary care for many common mental and behavioral problems
- Supported work settings to help Veterans join the work force and live well in the community 

We also provide care to Veterans in crisis. This includes:

- Emergency mental health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through VA medical centers and some local, non-VA hospitals
- The Veterans Crisis Line, which offers 24/7 support for Veterans in crisis and their families and friends

All mental health care at VA supports recovery. Our goal is to help you take charge of your treatment and live a full and meaningful life. Our providers also receive training about military culture, gender differences, and ethnic issues so that we can better understand each Veteran.
