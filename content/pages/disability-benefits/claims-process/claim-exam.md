After you [file your disability benefits claim](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/), VA may ask you to undergo a claim exam. This is also known as a compensation and pension (C&P) exam.

VA uses a claim exam to help determine your [disability rating](/disability-benefits/claims-process/ratings/). VA may also ask you to come in for a VA claim exam if you [appeal your disability benefits decision](/disability-benefits/claims-appeal/).

A claim exam is not like a normal doctor’s visit. The purpose of the exam is to gather information specific to your claim, not to treat or diagnose your condition(s). Here’s what you can expect:  

-	The examiner will address only the service-connected conditions you've claimed and any related conditions.
-	The examiner will ask you a standardized series of questions about your injury or illness. These questions are from the [Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)](http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp), and based on each condition.
-	The examiner may have you get other tests, such as X-rays or blood work, to support your claim.
-	The amount of time you spend at your exam depends on many factors. For example, the required questions for a documented knee injury may take only a few minutes, while the questions for a more complicated injury could take much longer.  

If you have enough medical evidence in your file to support your claim, VA may not require a claim exam to rate your disability. 

### Who will examine me?

The examiner may be a VA clinician or a private-sector clinician who VA has contracted to perform the exam. Your own doctor may also [examine you and fill out the necessary forms](http://benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_veteraninstruct.asp).  

CALL OUT BOX
### Don’t miss your exam appointment

VA will call you to schedule the exam using the phone number you entered in [eBenefits] (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage). If VA can't reach you by phone, we'll send you an appointment letter by U.S. mail.

**It's very important for you to go to your appointment.** The exam is part of the evidence used to rate your overall disability.

-	If you miss your exam, VA may deny your claim.
-	If you can’t make your appointment, let VA know immediately.
-	You can reschedule the appointment, but it may delay your claim.

To reschedule your appointment:

-	Call 1-800-827-1000, or
-	Contact VA through an [online chat](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/chat/chatstart.aspx?domain=1010ez), or
-	Go to your nearest [benefits regional office](https://www.vets.gov/facility-locator/).

### Keep in touch

It’s important to keep your contact information up to date in [eBenefits] (https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) so VA can let you know when to come in for your appointment.

#### Common questions

##### What information will the VA claims processor have?

This person can see the medical records you have given to VA, statements from you and others about your claim, and your military medical and personnel records. If you have new non-VA medical records that you haven't given to VA yet, such as records for a recent surgery, bring them to the exam.

##### Will I get my exam results at the VA claim exam?

No. The clinician will give the exam results to VA claims processors, who will make a decision about your claim based on this evidence along with your other medical and military records. 

After your exam, it takes VA an average of two weeks to send you a letter with your rating decision. If you would like a copy of the final report, visit [MyHealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov) or call VA at 1-800-827-1000.  


##### What happens after the exam?

VA will review all the evidence in your file, determine your rating, and send you a decision notice, which includes details about your exam rating. You will get a decision notice about two weeks after the exam.

##### What will happen if I don't go to my VA claim exam?

VA may determine your disability benefit based on the evidence it already has—which may not be enough. However, missing your exam won't affect your compensation or rating if you have “good cause” not to be there. "Good cause" includes:
- An illness or hospitalization
- Serious illness or injury of someone in your immediate family
- Bad weather
- A previously scheduled and paid-for commitment, such as a vacation

If you miss your claim exam, you’ll need to let VA know why you didn’t make it.
