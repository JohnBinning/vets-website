Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) provides special career counseling and support to Servicemembers and Veterans who are overcoming challenges linked to service-connected disabilities (disabilities from injuries or illnesses caused—or made worse—by active military service). For Servicemembers and Veterans with service-connected disabilities so severe that they can't consider work right away, VR&amp;E offers services to help them live as independently as possible while looking for work. In some cases, qualified family members can use VR&amp;E services too. Find out if you qualify—and apply for VR&amp;E benefits now.

### Can I get VR&amp;E benefits?

You may qualify for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Servicemember who:

- Has a 20% or higher predischarge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, **or**
- Is participating in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) process or awaiting discharge due to a medical condition resulting from a serious injury or illness that occurred in the line of duty

You may also qualify for VR&amp;E benefits if you're a Veteran who was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable, and you:
- Have a 10% or higher disability rating, **and**
- Separated from the military or received a service-connected disability rating from VA within the past 12 years

**Note:** Veterans may qualify for VR&amp;E benefits after 12 years if we conclude that more time is needed because of their employment handicap.

</li>

<li class="step six wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">
If you're a Servicemember who hasn't yet received a service-connected disability rating, you don't need to wait for a rating. Instead, please fill out VA Form 28-0588 (VA Vocational Rehabilitation - Getting Ahead After You Get Out). [Download Form 28-0588](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-28-0588-ARE.pdf).

**Note:** Servicemembers going through the Physical Evaluation Board process, as well as Servicemembers who expect an other-than-dishonorable discharge and who have a VA memorandum rating of 20% or more, or are in the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES), may qualify for VR&amp;E services.
</li>

<li class="step last seven wow fadeIn animated animated" markdown="0">
After you apply, we'll schedule a meeting for you with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to figure out if you have an employment handicap and if you qualify for VR&amp;E benefits and services. You have an employment handicap if your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to prepare for, find, and keep a job that suits your skills and needs. After we make an entitlement decision, you and your counselor will work together to create a rehabilitation plan. This plan outlines the rehabilitation and other services that VR&amp;E will provide.
