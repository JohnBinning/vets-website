<div class="va-introtext">

If you have a service-connected disability that makes it hard for you to work or prevents you from working, our Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) program can help you explore career options and get more training. In some cases, your family members may qualify for VR&amp;E benefits too.
