<div class="va-introtext">

If you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability, you can return to the job you held before deploying to active service because of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). A service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. If you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability, find out if Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) can help you return to your old job by supporting your employer in meeting your needs. 

[Learn more about USERRA](http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/userra/).
