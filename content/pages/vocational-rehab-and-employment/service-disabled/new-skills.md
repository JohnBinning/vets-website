If service-connected disabilities make it difficult for you to succeed in your career path, you may qualify for training through Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) that will help you find employment in a different field that better suits your abilities.

You may be eligible for this even if you also qualify for [GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/).  However, you must decide which benefit you want to use.



<div class="call-out" markdown="1">

### Are you eligible for VR&amp;E assistance?

Yes, if:

- You are a Veteran or Servicemember with a service-connected disability, have an employment barrier or handicap, and are [enrolled in VR&amp;E](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).
- Your service-connected disabilities make it difficult for you to prepare for, get, and keep suitable employment.

</div>

#### Who can apply

You and your family

### Available benefits

- Comprehensive skills assessment
- Access to a career counselor
- Education or training for a suitable vocational field, possibly including volunteer positions and on-the-job training

<hr>

### How it works

[Apply for VR&amp;E](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/) to find a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor who can assist you.

VR&amp;E is an employment program different from the GI Bill that may be used to pay for education needed to train you for suitable employment.
