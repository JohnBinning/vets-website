If your service-connected disability makes it hard for you to work and you need support to live more independently—or your goal is to work toward greater independence as you look for a job—you may qualify for independent-living services. Find out if you can get help with restoring your ability to take care of everyday tasks (like bathing, dressing, and getting around).

### Can I get independent-living services through VR&amp;E?

You may qualify for independent-living services if you qualify for Vocational Rehab and Employment (VR&E) benefits, **and**:

- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher, **and**
- Your injuries prevent you from seeking or returning to work right away, **and**
- Your case manager refers you after you sign up for the VR&amp;E program

Having a service-connected disability means we've concluded that you were disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by your active military service. Your disability rating reflects how severe your disability is.

### How do I get these benefits?

First, you’ll need to apply for VR&E benefits. Then, you’ll work with your Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Follow these steps:

<ol class="process">

<li class="step one">

[Apply for VR&E benefits](/vocational-rehab-and-employment/apply-vre/).

</li>

<li class="step two">

We'll assign you a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Your VRC will work with you to figure out the severity of your service-connected disability, if you're ready to work, and if you'll benefit from independent-living services.

</li>

<li class="step last three">

Your VRC will help you create a personal independent-living plan that meets your needs. Services may include:
- Evaluation and counseling to figure out your needs and goals
- Home consultations with specialists
- Referral to support resources
- Guidance to help you understand if you qualify for our adaptive-housing programs (which can help you make changes to your home—like widening doorways or adding ramps—to help you live more independently)

</li>

</ol>

Most qualified Servicemembers and Veterans get independent-living services for up to 24 months. In some cases, services may be used for longer.
