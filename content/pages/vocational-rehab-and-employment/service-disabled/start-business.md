If you're a Veteran with a service-connected disability and an employment barrier who has the desire and skills to run a successful business, you may be interested in the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) self-employment track.

Through this program, a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) can guide you through the process of starting your own business.
