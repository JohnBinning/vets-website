<div class="va-introtext">

As the family member of a disabled Servicemember or Veteran, you may have had to put your career and personal goals on hold because of the important support role you play. If the Servicemember or Veteran in your family qualifies for Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&amp;E) benefits, you may be able to get vocational (job) and educational counseling too. Find out if you qualify for counseling to help you return to work or school while you continue to care for the Servicemember or Veteran.

### Can I get VR&amp;E counseling?

You may qualify for VR&amp;E benefits if at least 1 of these is true:

- You're the dependent of a Veteran, and you qualify for a VA education benefit, **or**
- Your spouse or parent has been listed as Missing in Action for more than 90 days, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or detained (held) or interred by a foreign government or power, **or**
- You're the child of a Vietnam War Veteran, and you've been diagnosed with spina bifida or other specified birth defects

You may also be able to get VR&amp;E benefits if you're the spouse or child of a Servicemember or Veteran who:

- Died from a service-connected disability, **or**
- Has a permanent and total service-connected disability, **or**
- Died with a permanent and total service-connected disability, **or**
- Is referring care for a service-connected disability that is considered totally and permanently disabling, and which will likely cause the Servicemember to be discharged from the military

A service-connected disability means we've concluded that the Servicemember or Veteran was disabled by an injury or illness caused—or made worse—by their active military service. A permanent and total disability is one we've rated at 100% disabling (our rating system for measuring how severe the disability is) and that we don't expect to improve.

### What kind of VR&amp;E benefits can I get?

You can get educational and vocational counseling, plus help with:
 
- Exploring your abilities and interests
- Mapping out a career path
- Planning the best use of your VA benefits

### How do I get these benefits?

You'll need to apply for services. When you apply, choose "Education and Vocational Counseling" as your program track. If you qualify, we'll invite you to meet with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). Your VRC will work with you to map out a career path. [Apply online through eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/about/feature?feature=vocational-rehabilitation-and-employment).

**Note:** If the Servicemember or Veteran in your family isn't yet using VR&amp;E benefits and services, they can also apply online through eBenefits.
